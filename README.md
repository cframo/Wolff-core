<h4 align="center">Core is the brain of the Wolff.</h4>

Wolff is a ridiculously small and lightweight PHP framework which follows the MVC pattern while having useful functions and utilities like a template, route, loader, session and language system. 


Core is just the most essential part of Wolff, do not look for database connection or how to pass get / post variables here. Core's job is the routing and a only little more. 

The purpose of this, it's make little parts that can be connect with each other, depending of your needs.
